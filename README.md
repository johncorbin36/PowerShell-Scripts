# PowerShell Scripts Repository

This repository serves as a centralized location to host my library of PowerShells scripts. All scripts have been written by me using the Microsoft docs. Please feel free to use them for yourself.

## Azure-Scripts
This folder contains all PowerShell scripts using the Azure Active Directory dependency.

#### Add-To-Group.ps1
This script can add multiple users to a single group by using the Add-AzureADGroupMember command. Best for bulk additions.

#### Remove-From-Group.ps1

## Exchange-Scripts
This folder contains all PowerShell scripts using the Exchange Online Management dependency.

## Office-Scripts
